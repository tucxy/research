\chapter{Additional Results} \label{chap:Additional Results}

We present two main additional results produced by work done on this project. (1) Wraparound edge mappings that preserve lengths and (2) Galaxy graph decompositions of bipartite graphs.

\section{Wraparound edge mappings that preserve lengths}

These mappings only apply to vertices in $K_{2mt+m}$ and $K_{2mt+(m+1)}$ where $m>1$ is odd. Also, these are meant to be used in labelings which will be developed by $m$, such as our (1-2-3)-labelings and 1-rotational (1-2-3)-labelings, otherwise one could just map them anywhere really. Anyways, this is a somewhat invasive way to deal with wraparound edges, and it should be noted that this is a barebones sort of framework to begin dealing with wraparound edges in labelings. Note that `new' short edge mappings will be fixed after the first step from the base graphs. However the `new' wraparound edges will change at every step.

If $uv$ is a wraparound edge of length $l$ in $K_{3m}$, its length eventually will not be preserved at some step $t\mapsto t+c$ for $c\geq 1$ in the infinite family of graphs of the form $K_{2mt+m}$. So the idea is, maybe we can map the wraparound edge to a (1) a short edge of length $l$ at each step $t\mapsto t+1$ or (2) a wraparound edge of length $l$ at each step $t\mapsto t+1$ so that lengths will be preserved. The next theorem is something alluded to as an observation to previously, but we prove it anyways.\newpage
\begin{thm} \label{thm:wraplarger}
    In $K_{n}$ whose vertices we take to be $\ZZ_{n}$, $uv$ is a wraparound edge if and only if the absolute difference of its endpoints is greater than the maximal length in $K_{n};\floor{\frac{n}{2}}<|u-v|$. 
    \begin{proof}
        Let $uv$ be an edge in $K_{n}$ via $\ell$ defined previously. If $uv$ is a wraparound edge, then $n-|u-v|<|u-v|$. So then $\frac{n}{2}-\frac{|u-v|}{2}<\frac{|u-v|}{2}$, and therefore $\floor{\frac{n}{2}}\leq \frac{n}{2}<|u-v|$. If $\floor{\frac{n}{2}}\leq \frac{n}{2}<|u-v|$, note that without loss of generality $u<v$. Then necessarily $n-|u-v|=n-(v-u)<v-u=|u-v|$, so then $n<2(v-u)$ and $\floor{\frac{n}{2}}\leq\frac{n}{2}<(v-u)<|u-v|.$
    
        Thus,
        $$\floor{\frac{n}{2}}<|u-v|\Longleftrightarrow\text{ uv is a wraparound edge.}$$
    \end{proof}
    \end{thm}
There is likely a simpler proof for the following theorem. However, time was spent on more important tasks and this is what we have to offer in this paper. Also we use the notation $uv$ and $(u,v)$ for edges interchangably here to clean things up a bit.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:genwrapmap}
Let us define the following edge length functions

\begin{align*}
    \ell_{n}(u,v)&=
      \begin{cases}
        \min\{|u-v|,n-|u-v|\}, & u,v\in \mathbb{Z}_{n},\\
        \infty, & u=\infty\text{ or }v=\infty,
      \end{cases}\\
    \ell_{n}^{+}(u,v)&=
      \begin{cases}
        u+v\mathbf{\,mod\,}n, & u,v\in \mathbb{N},\\
        u\mathbf{\,mod\,}n,   & u=\infty,\\
        v\mathbf{\,mod\,}n,   & v=\infty.
      \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
\noindent Now, let $t>1$, and let $m>1$ be odd. Lastly, let $h =2m(t-1)$. For any wraparound edge $(a,b)$ in $K_{21}$ such that $a<b$, we have
\begin{align}
  \ell_{3m}(a,b)
    &=\ell_{2mt+m}(a-h,b-h)
     =\ell_{2mt+m}(a+h,b+h)
  \tag{short}\label{eq:short}\\
  \ell_{3m}(a,b)
    &=\ell_{m}^{+}(a-h,b-h)
     =\ell_{m}^{+}(a+h,b+h)
  \tag{wraparound}\label{eq:wraparound}
\end{align}
That is, these mappings preserve the standard length $\ell$ and additive length $\ell_{m}^{+}$ modulo $m$ of $ab\in E(K_{3m})$ in $K_{2mt+m}$ and in $K_{2mt+(m+1)}$ where we take $K_{2mt+(m+1)}$ to be $\ZZ_{2mt+m}\cup \{\infty\}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Since $uv$ is a wraparound edge where $u<v$, $\ell_{3m}(u,v)=3m-|u-v|=3m-(v-u)=3m+u-v$. Let us simply denote this via $\ell_{ab}=3m+a-b$. Now, let $k=\floor{\frac{m}{2}}=\frac{m-1}{2}$ so the maximal length in $K_{3m}$ is $\floor{\frac{3m}{2}}=\floor{\frac{2m+m}{2}}=\floor{\frac{2m}{2}+\frac{m}{2}}=m+\floor{\frac{m}{2}}=m+k$ since $k,m\geq 1$. Suppose $a\geq 2m$. Then, $(2m\geq a<b<3m)\implies (1\leq b-a<m<m+k).$ But then $|a-b|<m+k$, the maximal length and so $ab$ is not a wraparound edge, a contradiction. So $a<b<2m$.\newline

\noindent (short): Let $\alpha= a-h,\beta=b\in \ZZ_{2mt+m}$. Note: $2mt+m-h\equiv 2mt+m-2m(t-1)=2m+m=3m$. Therefore, $3m+a\equiv (2mt+m-h)+a\equiv a-h \pmod{2mt+m}$. So then since $1<t$, we have that $3m+a<3m+2m=2m(2)+m\leq 2mt+m$, and so in fact $\alpha = 3m+a$. Recall that $\beta=b<3m<3m+a=\alpha$. So then we have that $|\alpha-\beta|=\alpha-\beta=(3m+a)-b$. Well, $3m<2mt+m$ for $t>1$. So then $\ell_{2mt+m}(\alpha\beta)=\min\{|\alpha-\beta|,2mt+m-|\alpha-\beta|\}=\min\{3m+a-b, 2mt+m+a-b\}=3m+a-b=\ell_{ab}$.\newline

\noindent (wraparound): Instead, let $\alpha =a,\beta=b+h\in \ZZ_{2mt+m}$. Clearly, $\alpha=a<b+h=\beta$. So $|\alpha-\beta|=\beta-\alpha=b+h-a$. Recall that $ab$ is a wraparound edge in $K_{3m}$ with $a<b$. So then $|a-b|=b-a>m+k$, the maximal length in $K_{3m}$. So then $|\alpha-\beta|=b-a+h>m+k+h=m+k+2m(t-1)$. Now, the maximal length in $K_{2mt+m}$ is $\floor{\frac{2mt+m}{2}}=mt+k=m+k+m(t-1)$. Well, (i) $(2m(t^{*}-1))_{t^{*}\geq 2}$ and (ii) $(m(t^{*}-1))_{t^{*}\geq 2}$ are both arithmetic sequences with increments $2m$ and $m$, respectively. Both expressions are only equal at $t^{*}=1$, and then afterwards $(i)$ increases faster than $(ii)$. So then we see that $2m(t-1)>m(t-1)$ for all $t>1$, and thus, $|\alpha-\beta|=b-a+h>m+k+h=m+k+2m(t-1)>m+k+m(t-1)$, the maximal length in $K_{2mt+m}$ for $t>1$. So then $\alpha\beta$ is a wraparound edge in $K_{2mt+m}$ of length $2mt-m-|\alpha-\beta|=2mt+m-\beta-\alpha=2mt+m - (b-a+h)= 2mt+m-2m(t-1)+a-b=3m+a-b=\ell_{ab}$.

\end{proof}
Note that if we develop the mapped endpoints in (short) and (wraparound) by $c\in \NN$, edge lengths $\ell_{2mt+m},\ell_{m}^{+}$ are still preserved. Now, we don't provide any kind of labeling to extend this theorem, but we do provide some `guardrails' that one can implement in their labeling to avoid certain problems. Besides changing lengths of edges incident to vertices mapped this way in higher order family members, the only thing to worry about is the possibility that an endpoint mapped in a higher order complete graph actually collides with another vertex incident to a short edge (since most labels will presumably not be mapped). This can happen. However the next theorem gives way to a corollary that guarantees this will not happen given certain conditions are met.\newline
\begin{thm}
  Let $m>1\text{ be odd},t>1,\text{ and } h = 2m(t-1)$. Now let the vertices of $K_{3m}$ and $K_{2mt+m}$ to be $\ZZ_{3m}$ and $\ZZ_{2mt+m}$, respectively, and let $a,b$ be distinct vertices in $K_{3m}$ with $a<b$. Then,
    $$b-a\neq m\text{ or }b\not\equiv a\Mod{m}\Rightarrow a-h \neq b+h\text{ in }\ZZ_{2mt+m}$$

    \begin{proof}
        Recall that since $a,b\in \ZZ_{2m+m}$ and are distinct, $1\leq b-a<3m$.\newline 
        
        \noindent If $b-a\neq m,$ suppose $\alpha = \beta = a-h=b+h$. Then $b-a\equiv -2h\equiv -4m(t-1)\Mod{2mt+m}$. Well,  $-4m \equiv 2mt+m-4m\equiv 2mt-3m\equiv m(2t-3)\Mod{2mt+m}$. So we have that $$b-a\equiv [m(2t-3)][(t-1)]\Mod{2mt+m}.$$
        
        \noindent If $t=2$, $b-a\equiv m(2(2-3)(2-1))\equiv m\Mod{2m(2)+m}$ and so for $k\geq 1$, we have $b-a = m$ or $b-a= k(m+2m(2))+m = 5mk>3m$, both contradictions. So $\alpha\neq \beta$.\newline
        
        \noindent If $t>2$, $b-a\equiv [m(2t-3)][(t-1)] \equiv m(2t^{2}-5t+3)\Mod{2mt+m}$. So then $b-a=m(2t^{2}-5t+3)$ or $b-a=m(2t^{2}-5t+3) + k(2mt+m)$ for $t\geq 3$ and $k\geq 1$. Well, since $t\geq 3$, we have $m(2t^{2}-5t+3)\geq m(2(3)^{2}-5(3)+3)=6m$ and $2mt+m\geq 2m(3)+m=7m$ since both are strictly increasing for $t>2$. So then $b-a\geq 6m$ or $b-a\geq 6m+7mk$ for $t>2$, both contradictions since $1<b-a<3m$.\newline

        \noindent Finally, on the other hand if $b\not\equiv a\Mod{m}$, suppose $\alpha = \beta$. Then $a-h\equiv b-h \Mod{2mt+m}$ and $b-a\equiv -2h\equiv -4m(t-1)\Mod{2mt+m}$. So then $b-a\equiv 0\Mod{m}$ since $m|-4m(t-1)$ and $m|2mt+m.$ But then $b\equiv a\Mod{m}$, a contradiction. So $\alpha\neq \beta$, and the statement is proven.
        
    \end{proof}
\end{thm}

\begin{corollary}\label{thm:gennewvertices}
    Let $m>1\text{ be odd},\,t>1\text{ and }h=2m(t-1)$ and take the vertices of $K_{3m}$ and $K_{2mt+m}$ to be $\ZZ_{3m}$ and $\ZZ_{2mt+m}$, respectively. Next, let $a,b$ be distinct vertices in $K_{3m}$ such that $a<b$ and $a\equiv b\Mod{m}$. Then,
    \begin{align}
    &t=2\text{ and }|a-b|\neq 2m\iff a\pm h\neq b\text{ and }b\pm h \neq a\text{ in }\ZZ_{2mt+m}\\
    &t>2\implies a\pm h\neq b\text{ and }b\pm h \neq a\text{ in }\ZZ_{2mt+m}
    \end{align}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    Let $k=\floor{\frac{m}{2}}$. In the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:genwrapmap} it is shown that $a-h=3m+a$, so then since $0\leq a<3m$, $3m\leq 3m+a=a-h$ in $K_{2mt+m}$. Now, suppose $b\leq m$. Then since $a<b\leq m$ and $|a-b|=b-a$, necessarily $1\leq |a-b|\leq m<m+k$, the maximal length in $K_{3m}$. But then by Theorem \ref{thm:wraplarger}, $ab$ is not a wraparound edge, a contradiction. So $b>m$. Therefore $b+h>m+h\geq 3m$.\newline

    \noindent We prove $(6.1)$ by contrapositive. For $t=2$, $h=2m$ and if $a+h = b$ or $a-h=b$, then $|a-b|=h=2m$. On the other hand if $|a-b|=h$, then $a-b=h$ or $a-b=-h$ and then $a+h = b$ or $a-h=b$. Thus, the contrapositive holds and $(6.1)$ is proven.\newline

    \noindent If $t>2$, then recall that $2mt+m=3m+2m(t-1)=3m+h$. So then since $0\leq u<v<3m$, we have that $h\leq u+h<v+h<3m+h=2mt+m$. Now, $h=2m(t-1)\geq 2m(3-1)=4m$ for $t>2$. So, $$0\leq u<v<3m<4m \leq u+h<v+h<3m+h=2mt+m\text{ for }t>2.$$ Therefore, $u+h\neq v$ and $v+ h\neq u$. Now, since $2mt+m-h=3m$, $2mt+m+(v-h)\equiv 3m+v\Mod{2mt+m}$ and similarly $2mt+m+(u-h)\equiv 3m+u\Mod{2mt+m}$, we have that $u-h$ and $v-h$ are simply $3m+u$ and $3m+v$, respectively, in $\ZZ_{2mt+m}$. Well, $$0\leq u<v<3m<4m\leq 3m+u<3m+v<5m\leq 2mt+m\text{ for }t>2.$$
    Therefore, $u-h\neq v$ and $v-h\neq u$ in $\ZZ_{2mt+m}$, and $(6.2)$ is proven.

\end{proof}
    This concludes the results of this section. The next section is a fun result that came as a result of dealing with the exceptional graph in Chapter \ref{chap:special case}.

\section{Galaxy Decompositions of Complete Bipartite Graphs}

In Chapter \ref{chap:special case}, we view $\mathbf{T_{7}^{11}}\sqcup\mathbf{T_{2}^{1}}$ as a forest, but it is also a galaxy. After finding the labeling in Figure \ref{fig:starpathbip}, it became clear we could generalize this idea to all galaxies. We begin with galaxy decompositions of complete bipartite graphs.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:galdecomp}
Let $N\text{ and }m$ be positive integers and consider the complete bipartite $K_{N,m}$ with a finite collection $C=\{G_{i}\mid i\in \ZZ_{n}\}$ of vertex disjoint stars. If $0<n\leq N$ and $m=\sum_{i\in \ZZ_{n}}|E(G_{i})|$, then there exists a $C$-galaxy decomposition of $K_{N,m}$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  Take the partite set of $N$ vertices to be $\ZZ_{N}$ and color them white. Similarly, take the partite set of $m$ vertices to be $\ZZ_{m}$ and color them black. Note that we will be using vertices as group elements. Naturally, we refer to \textit{white-black} vertices $uv$ in $K_{N,m}$ via $(u,v)\in \ZZ_{N}\times \ZZ_{m}$ and vice versa. Next, let $\GG=\bigsqcup_{i\in \ZZ_{n}}G_{i}$, a $C$-galaxy. Lastly, let $L_{0}=\{0,\hdots,|E(G_{0})|\}$, $L_{i}=\{|E(G_{i-1})|,\hdots,|E(G_{i})|-1\}$ for $i\in \ZZ^{*}_{n}$ and $\GG_{j}\subseteq K_{N,m}$ be the subgraph induced by $E_{j}=\sqcup_{i\in \ZZ_{n}} (\{i+j\}\times L_{i})$ for each $j\in \ZZ_{N}$ and note that these subgraphs are all isomorphic to $\GG$.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \input{standalone/galaxydecomp}
    \caption{$\GG_{0}$ in a generating presentation of the $C$-galaxy decomposition of $K_{N,m}$.}
    \label{fig:galdecomp}
\end{figure}
\noindent Consider any edge $(u,v)\in K_{N,m}$. Well, $\ZZ_{m}=L_{0}\sqcup \cdots \sqcup L_{n-1}$, so $v\in L_{a}$ for exactly one $a\in \ZZ_{n}$. So then $(u,v)\in \{u\}\times L_{a}=\{a+b\}\times L_{i}\subseteq \sqcup_{i\in \ZZ_{n}} (\{i+b\}\times L_{a})=E_{b}$ where $b=u-a\in \ZZ_{N}$. There is only one such $b\in \ZZ_{N}$. Therefore, any edge $(u,v)\in K_{N,m}$ belongs to exactly one isomorphic copy $\GG_{b}$ of $\GG$ in $\{\GG_{i}\mid i\in \ZZ_{N}\}$.\newline

Thus,
\begin{center}
$\{\GG_{i}\mid i\in \ZZ_{N}\}$ is a $C$-galaxy decomposition of $K_{N,m}$.
\end{center}
  
\end{proof}
Next, we extend this idea to complete multipartite graphs.
\begin{corollary}
Let $m$ be a positive integer and $N_{0},\hdots,N_{k-1}$ be positive integers which are divisible by $m$. If $C=\{G_{i}\mid i\in \ZZ_{n}\}$ is a collection of vertex disjoint stars where $0<n\leq \min\{N_{0},\hdots,N_{k-1}\}$ and $m=\sum_{i\in \ZZ_{n}} |E(G_{i})|$, then there exists a $C$-galaxy decomposition of the complete $k$-partite graph $K_{N_{0},\hdots,N_{k-1}}$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Let $d_{i}=\frac{n_{i}}{m}$ for each $i\in \ZZ_{k}$. $K_{N_{1},\hdots,N_{k}}$ can be viewed as the union of $\sum\limits_{0\leq i<j<k} d_{i}d_{j}$ copies of $K_{m,m}$. Well, $m=\sum_{i\in \ZZ_{n}} |E(G_{i})|$ so the maximal number of stars $n$ in $C$ is $m$, so $n\leq m$ and by Theorem \ref{thm:galdecomp} the $C$-galaxy decomposes $K_{m,m}$. Therefore the $C$-galaxy decomposes any number of copies of $K_{m,m}$ and so it decomposes $K_{N_{1},\hdots,N_{k}}$.
\end{proof}
This corollary concludes this chapter and the results of this thesis project. We hope to extend this galaxy idea in future work. The next section contains \verb|python| programs made for this project.
