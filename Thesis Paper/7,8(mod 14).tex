\chapter{$\mathbf{n\equiv 7,8\textbf{(mod 14)}}$}

In this section, we use our own constructions based on the same edge length definition as in the previous section. The first one addresses the $n \equiv 7 \pmod{14}$ case.

\begin{definition}\label{def:1-2-3}
    Let $G$ be a graph with $7$ edges. A (1-2-3)-\emph{labeling} of $3G$ is an assignment $f$ of the integers $\{0,\dots,20\}$ to the vertices of $3G$ such that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $f(u) \neq f(v)$ whenever $u$ and $v$ belong to the same connected component, 
        \item[] and
        %\item there are exactly $7$ edges of length $i$ for each $i \in \{1,2,3\}$, and
       % \item if two edges $u_1v_1$ and $u_2v_2$ are of length $i$ and $u_1 \equiv v_1 \pmod7$, then $u_2 \not \equiv v_2 \pmod7.$
      %  \item when $f$ is reduced modulo $7$, there is exactly one edge of length $j$, for $j \in \{1,2,3\}$, of the form $\{i,i+j\}$ for $i \in \{0,\dots,6\}.$
        \item $$ \bigcup_{uv\in E(3G)} \{(f(u)\; \textbf{mod } 7,f(v)\; \textbf{mod } 7)\}= \bigcup_{i=0}^{6} \bigcup_{j=1}^{3} \{(i,i+j \; \textbf{mod } 7)\}.$$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
Notice that the second condition of a (1-2-3)-labeling says that $3G$ contains exactly $7$ edges of each of the lengths $1,2$, and $3$. Furthermore, no two edges of the same length have the same end labels when reduced modulo $7.$ A (1-2-3) labeling of every forest with $7$ edges with the exception of $\mathbf{T_{7}^{11}}\sqcup\mathbf{T_{2}^{1}}$ is given in Figure \ref{fig:7mod14}. This exceptional forest does not admit such a labeling and is dealt with in Section \ref{sec:star}.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:1-2-3 plus rho}
    Let $G$ be a bipartite graph with $7$ edges. If $3G$ admits a ($1$-$2$-$3$)-labeling and $G$ admits a $\rho^{+}$-labeling, then $G$ decomposes $K_{14k+7}$ for every $k\geq1.$
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Let $n=14k+7$ and notice that $K_n$ has $|E(K_n)|=(7k+3)(14k+7)$ edges, which can be partitioned into $14k+7$ edges of each of the lengths in $\{1,2,\dots,7k+3\}.$  We will construct the $G$-decomposition in two steps. First, we use the 1-2-3-labeling to identify all the edges of lengths $1,2,$ and $3$ accounting for $3(2k+1)$ copies of $G$. Then, we use the $\rho^{+}$-labeling to identify edges of the remaining lengths in $7k(2k+1)$ copies of $G$. In total, the decomposition consists of $|E(K_n)|/7=(7k+3)(2k+1)$ copies of $G.$

    % Is developing by k defined?
    Let $f_1$ be a (1-2-3)-labeling of $3G$ and identify this graph as a block $B_0$. Then develop $B_0$ by 7 modulo $n$. Since the order of the development is $\frac{n}{7}=2k+1$ and there are 7 edges of each of the lengths $1,2,$ and $3$ in $B_0$, we have identified $3(2k+1)$ copies of $G$ containing all $14k+7=n$ edges of each length $1,2,$ and $3$. Notice (2) of Definition \ref{def:1-2-3} ensures no edge has been counted more than once in the development.

    Let $f_2:V(G) \rightarrow \{0,\dots,14\}$ be a $\rho^{+}$-labeling of $G$ with associated vertex partition $(A,B).$ For $i=1,2,\dots,k,$ identify blocks $B_i \cong G$ with vertex labels $\ell$ such that
    \[
    \ell(v)=
    \begin{cases}
        f_2(v), & \textrm{if } v \in A \\
        f_2(v)+3+7(i-1), & \textrm{if } v \in B
    \end{cases}
    \]
    Notice that the $i^{\textrm{th}}$ block contains exactly one edge of each length $7i-3,7i-2, \dots,$ and $ 7i+3.$ This is because every edge $ab$ has length 
    \[
    \ell(b)-\ell(a)=f_2(b)-f_2(a)+3+7(i-1)
    \]
    and $f_2(b)-f_2(a)$ is a length in $\{1,\dots,7\}.$
    Developing each block $B_i$ by 1 yields $14k+7$ copies of $G$ per block and accounts for $14k+7$ edges of each of the lengths $4,5,\dots,$ and $7k+3$.

    Since we have identified
    \[
    3(2k+1)+k(14k+7)=(7k+3)(2k+1)
    \]
    edge-disjoint copies of $G$, the proof is complete.
    % $f_2+3, f_2 + 10, \dots, f_2 + 3+7(k-1)$
    %Because $f_2$ is a $\rho$-labeling, it induces exactly one edge of each length $1,2,\dots,7.$ Further, because it is a $\rho^{+}$-labeling, fixing the labels of the $A$ vertices and increasing the set of $B$ vertices each by an integer $c$ increases the lengths by $c.$ We call this process \emph{stretching} the edges. 
\end{proof}
%%%
To address the $n \equiv 8 \pmod{14}$ case, we define the following labeling.
\begin{definition}\label{def:1-2-3-1-rot}
    Let $G$ be a graph with $7$ edges. A \emph{1-rotational $(1$-$2$-$3)$-labeling} of $4G$ is an assignment $f$ of $\{0,\dots,20\} \cup \infty$ to the vertices of $4G$ such that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $f(u) \neq f(v)$ whenever $u$ and $v$ belong to the same connected component, 
        \item[] and
%\item when the integer values of $f$ are reduced modulo $7$, there is exactly one edge of length $j$, for $j \in \{1,2,3\}$, of the form $\{i,i+j\}$ for $i \in \{0,\dots,6\},$ and exactly one edge of length $\infty$ of the form $\{i,\infty\}$ for $i \in \{0,\dots,6\}.$
        \item  $$ \bigcup_{uv\in E(4G)} \{(f(u)\; \textbf{mod } 7,f(v)\; \textbf{mod } 7)\}= \bigcup_{i=0}^{6} \bigcup_{j=1}^{3} \{(i,i+j \; \textbf{mod } 7), (i,\infty)\}.$$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
Notice that the second condition of a 1-rotational (1-2-3)-labeling says that $4G$ contains exactly $7$ edges of each of the lengths $1,2,3$, and $\infty$. Furthermore, no two edges of the same length have the same end labels when reduced modulo $7.$ A 1-rotational (1-2-3)-labeling of every forest with $7$ edges with the exception of $\mathbf{T_{7}^{11}}\sqcup\mathbf{T_{2}^{1}}$ is given in Figure \ref{fig:8mod14}. 

\begin{thm}\label{thm:1-2-3 1-rot plus rho}
    Let $G$ be a bipartite graph with $7$ edges. If $4G$ admits a $1$-rotational  $(1$-$2$-$3)$-labeling and $G$ admits a $\rho^{+}$-labeling, then $G$ decomposes $K_{14k+8}$ for every $k\geq1.$
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    Let $n=14k+8$ and notice that $K_n$ has $|E(K_n)|=(7k+4)(14k+7)$ edges, which can be partitioned into $14k+7$ edges of each of the lengths in $\{1,2,\dots,7k+3,\infty\}.$  We will construct the $G$-decomposition in two steps. First, we use the 1-rotational (1-2-3)-labeling to identify all the edges of lengths $1,2,3,$ and $\infty$ accounting for $4(2k+1)$ copies of $G$. Then, we use the $\rho^{+}$-labeling to identify edges of the remaining lengths in $7k(2k+1)$ copies of $G$. In total, the decomposition consists of $|E(K_n)|/7=(7k+4)(2k+1)$ copies of $G.$

    Let $f_1$ be a 1-rotational (1-2-3)-labeling of $4G$ and identify this graph as a block $B_0$. Then develop $B_0$ by 7 modulo $n-1$. Since the order of the development is $\frac{n-1}{7}=2k+1$ and there are 7 edges of each of the lengths $1,2,3$ and $\infty$ in $B_0$, we have identified $4(2k+1)$ copies of $G$ containing all $14k+7=n-1$ edges of each length $1,2,3$ and $\infty$. Notice (2) of Definition \ref{def:1-2-3-1-rot} ensures no edge has been counted more than once in the development.

    Let $f_2:V(G) \rightarrow \{0,\dots,14\}$ be a $\rho^{+}$-labeling of $G$ with associated vertex partition $(A,B).$ For $i=1,2,\dots,k,$ identify blocks $B_i \cong G$ with vertex labels $\ell$ such that
    \[
    \ell(v)=
    \begin{cases}
        f_2(v), & \textrm{if } v \in A \\
        f_2(v)+3+7(i-1), & \textrm{if } v \in B
    \end{cases}
    \]
    Notice that the $i^{\textrm{th}}$ block contains exactly one edge of each length $7i-3,7i-2, \dots,$ and $ 7i+3.$ This is because every edge $ab$ has length 
    \[
    \ell(b)-\ell(a)=f_2(b)-f_2(a)+3+7(i-1)
    \]
    and $f_2(b)-f_2(a)$ is a length in $\{1,\dots,7\}.$
    Developing each block $B_i$ by 1 yields $14k+7$ copies of $G$ per block and accounts for $14k+7$ edges of each of the lengths $4,5,\dots,$ and $7k+3$.

    Since we have identified
    \[
    4(2k+1)+k(14k+7)=(7k+4)(2k+1)
    \]
    edge-disjoint copies of $G$, the proof is complete.
\end{proof}

We are now able to state the main thm of this section.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:7 or 8 mod 14}
    Let $F$ be a forest with $7$ edges and $F \not \cong \mathbf{T_{7}^{11}}\sqcup\mathbf{T_{2}^{1}}$. There exists an $F$-decomposition of $K_n$ whenever $n \equiv 7 \textrm{ or } 8 \pmod{14}$ and $n \geq 21.$
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    If $n \equiv 7 \pmod{14},$ a (1-2-3)-labeling of $3F$ can be found in Figure \ref{fig:7mod14}. On the other hand, if $n \equiv 8 \pmod{14}$, then a 1-rotational (1-2-3)-labeling of $4F$ can be found in Figure \ref{fig:8mod14}. In either case, a $\rho^{+}$-labeling of $F$ can be found in Figure \ref{fig:sigma plus minus} (recall that a $\sigma^{+-}$-labeling is a $\rho^{+}$-labeling). The result now follows from Theorems \ref{thm:1-2-3 plus rho} and \ref{thm:1-2-3 1-rot plus rho}.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
We illustrate the constructions in the previous two thms by finding an $F$-decomposition of $K_{35}$ and $K_{36}$ for the forest graph $F \cong \mathbf{T_{6}^{6}} \sqcup \mathbf{T_{3}^{1}}$.
