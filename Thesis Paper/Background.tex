\section{Fundamentals of Graph Theory}

Graph Theory is the study of objects called \textit{vertices} or \textit{nodes} and their relationships which we call \textit{edges}. An edge between vertices $u$ and $v$ is typically denoted $uv$ or $(u,v)$. A graph $G$ is formally defined as an ordered pair $G = (V,E)$ where $V$ is the set of all vertices in $G$ and $E$ is the set of all edges between vertices in $G$. These sets are sometimes denoted $V(G)$ and $E(G)$, respectively.

$G$ is called a \textit{simple graph} if (1) there is at most one edge between any two vertices, (2) there are no edges from a vertex to itself and (3) all edges have no directionality to them, meaning $uv=vu$ for any edge $uv\in E(G)$. For the rest of this paper all graphs we work with are finite simple graphs, but note that many of the proceeding definitions are defined in the same or very similar ways for infinite and directed graphs.

Graphs are more intuitive to work with through their visual representations instead of their formal definitions. Let $G$ be a simple graph where $V(G)=\{A,B,C,D,E,a,b,c,\newline d, e\}$ and $E(G)=\{Aa,Bb,Cc,Dd,Ee,AB,BC,CD,DE,EA,ac,ce,eb,bd,da\}$. G is often called the \textit{Petersen} graph. It's a bit unwieldy when described formally, yet its visual representation is very easy to understand.

We say two graphs $G$ and $H$ are \textit{isomorphic} if there exists a bijection from $V(G)$ to $V(H)$ called an \textit{isomorphism} that induces a bijection from $E(G)$ to $E(H)$ and we denote this relationship via $G\cong H$. In other words, we consider two graphs $G\text{ and }H$ to be the `same' if we can relabel and move vertices in some fashion (without adding/removing vertices and edges) in visual representations of $G$ and $H$ to go between the two.

Graph theorists generally consider two graphs to be the same if they are isomorphic because an isomorphism preserves all meaningful structural properties of a graph. We will wrap up the fundamentals with a few definitions and some important operations.

\begin{definition}[Subgraph] A subgraph $G\subseteq K$ is a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of the vertices and edges of $K$; $G\subseteq K$ if $V(G)\subseteq V(K)$ and $E(G)\subseteq E(K)$.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[Vertex-induced Subgraph] A \textit{vertex-induced} subgraph $G\subseteq K$ is one whose vertices are some subset of $V(K)$ and whose edges are all edges between those vertices in $K$; $V(G)\subseteq V(K)$ and $E(G)=\{uv\in E(K)\mid u,v\in V(G)\}$. If $G$ is such a subgraph we say that $G$ is induced by $S=V(G)\subseteq V(K)$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Edge-induced Subgraph] A \textit{edge-induced} subgraph $G\subseteq K$ is one whose edges are some subset of $E(K)$ and whose vertices are all those who appear as an endpoint in that subset of edges; $E(G)\subseteq E(K)$ and $V(G)=\{u\in V(K)\mid uv\in E(G)\text{ for some }v\in V(K)\}$. If $G$ is such a subgraph we say that $G$ is induced by $S=E(G)\subseteq E(K)$
\end{definition}

Here is a visual example of these types of graphs: Let $K$ be the Petersen graph from Figure \ref{fig:petersen graph}.
\begin{align*}
    &\textbf{Subgraph: } \textcolor{magenta}{G} \subseteq K \text{ where }\textcolor{magenta}{V(G)} = \textcolor{magenta}{\{E, e, b\}},\; \textcolor{magenta}{E(G)} = \textcolor{magenta}{\{Ee\}}.\\
    &\textbf{Vertex-induced Subgraph: } \textcolor{blue}{H} \subseteq K \text{ is induced by } \textcolor{blue}{\{a, A, B\}}\subseteq V(K)\\
    &\textbf{Edge-induced Subgraph: } \textcolor{red}{M} \subseteq K 
    \text{ is induced by }\textcolor{red}{\{Dd, DC, Cc\}}\subseteq E(K)
\end{align*}
The figure below shows $K$ and it's color-coded subgraphs.

Next, we will talk about two important operations done on graphs.

\begin{definition}[Graph Union]
The union of two graphs $G$ and $H$ is simply the graph resulting from the union of their vertices and the union of their edges and is denoted $G\cup H$; $G\cup H=(V(G)\cup V(H),E(G)\cup E(H))$. If $G$ and $H$ are vertex-disjoint, we may denote their union via $G\sqcup H$ and call it a \textit{disjoint union} of $G$ and $H$. If they are only edge-disjoint, we may call it an \textit{edge-disjoint union}. We also use $\sqcup$ in general to denote a union between disjoint sets; $A\sqcup B$ to denotes a union between sets $A$ and $B$ where $A\cap B=\emptyset$.
\end{definition} Here is an example of a union and a disjoint union of graphs. Let $G=(\{a,b,c,d\},\{ab,\newline bc,cd,da\}),H=(\{a,b,c\},\{ab,bc,ca\}),\text{ and }K=(\{A,B,C\},\{AB,BC,CA\})$ Then:
\begin{align*}
&G\cup H = (\{a,b,c,d\},\{ab,bc,cd,da,ca\})\\
&G\sqcup K=(\{a,b,c,d,A,B,C\},\{ab,bc,cd,da,AB,BC,CA\})
\end{align*}
These unions are depicted in the following figure.

Next, we define another very important operation that combines two vertex disjoint graphs in a different manner.

\begin{definition}[Join]
    Let $G$ and $H$ be vertex disjoint graphs. Their
    \textit{join}, denoted $G \vee H$, is the graph obtained by
    taking the disjoint union of $G$ and $H$ and adding all
    possible edges between every vertex in $G$ and every vertex
    in $H$. Formally:
    $$
      G \vee H
      \;=\;
      \bigl(
        V(G)\cup V(H),
        E(G)\;\cup\;E(H)\;\cup\;\{\,xy \mid x\in V(G),\, y\in V(H)\}
      \bigr).
    $$
  \end{definition}
Here is an example. Let $G=(\{a,b,c\},\{ab,bc,ca\})$ and $H=(\{A,B,C\},\{AB,BC,CA\})$, then $G\lor H=(\{a,b,c,A,B,C\},E(G)\sqcup E(H)\sqcup\{aA,aB,aC,bA,bB,bC,cA,cB,cC\})$. This join is depicted in the figure below.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={draw, circle, fill=black, minimum size=2pt, inner sep=0pt},scale=1]

        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \caption{$\,G\vee H$}
    \label{fig:join}
\end{figure}

Lastly, we define a few characteristics of graphs and their components. These may or may not be used frequently in this paper, but are important concepts to know in order to be able to talk about graphs comfortably.

Let $G$ be a simple graph. We say two vertices $u,v\in V(G)$ are \textit{adjacent} or \textit{neighbors} if they share an edge $uv\in E(G)$. Similarly, we say a vertex is \textit{incident} with an edge if it is one of it's endpoints; $u\in V(G)$ is incident with $e\in E(G)$ if $e=uv$ for some $v\in V(G)$. The set of all vertices adjacent to $v$ in $G$  is called the \textit{neighborhood} of $v$ denoted $N_{G}(v)$ or simply $N(v)$. Sometimes this is refered to as the open neighborhood of $v$ in $G$ and then the closed neighborhood is defined via $N_{G}[v]=N_{G}(v)\sqcup \{v\}$. The \textit{degree} of a vertex $v\in V(G)$ is the number of vertices adjacent to it and is denoted $deg_{G}(v)$ or simply $deg(v)$. Equivalently, the degree of a vertex $v$ is the number of edges incident with it or the number of $|N_{G}(v)|$ neighbors that $v$ has. We call a vertex of degree $1$ a \textit{leaf} and an edge incident with a leaf a \textit{pendant} edge.

The following are three similar types of objects found in graphs.

\begin{definition}[Walk]
Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices. A \textit{walk} in $G$ is a sequence $(w_{0},w_{1},\hdots,w_{k})$ of vertices in $G$ whose adjacent elements must be adjacent in $G$. Adjacent elements in a walk must be distinct vertices but a vertex may be repeated multiple times throughout the sequence.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Path]
Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices. A \textit{path} in $G$ is a sequence $(v_{0},v_{1},\hdots,v_{k})$ of distinct vertices in $G$ whose adjacent elements must be adjacent in $G$, and where no vertex is repeated throughout the sequence. This sequence gives the subgraph of $G$ induced by $\{v_{0}v_{1},v_{1}v_{2},\hdots,v_{k-1}v_{k}\}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Cycle]
Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices. A \textit{cycle} in $G$ is a sequence $(v_{0},v_{1},\hdots,v_{k},v_{0})$ of internally distinct vertices (distinct except on the endpoints) that begins and terminates at the same vertex $v_{0}$. Often such a cycle is denoted via $(v_{0}v_{1}\cdots v_{k})$ and it is understood that the sequence wraps back around to $v_{0}$ after $v_{k}$. Additionally, the cycle $(v_{0}v_{1}\cdots v_{k})$ is equivalent to $(v_{1}\cdots v_{k}v_{0})$, $(v_{2}\cdots v_{k}v_{0}v_{1}),\hdots$ and so on. 
\end{definition}

We call a simple graph $G$ \textit{acyclic} if it contains no cycles. If there exists a path from any vertex to every other vertex in $G$, then we call $G$ \textit{connected}. If not, we call $G$ \textit{disconnected}. We call the set of connected subgraphs of $G$ whose disjoint union equals $G$ the \textit{connected components} of $G$.

This concludes the fundamental concepts needed to understand this project. The next and final section of this chapter will introduce all the fundamental families of graphs we refer to in subsequent chapters.

\section{Fundamental Families of Graphs}

In this section we introduce some fundamental families of graphs which we refer to throughout this paper. Often, instead of fully defining the graphs being worked with, we simply refer to it as a member of a larger family of graphs or as isomorphic to a family member. Some of these families overlap. It may be helpful to view a graph as a member of one family or another depending on the context. 

Recall that a graph is acyclic if it contains no cycles. Similarly, we call a graph \textit{$k$-cyclic} if it contains exactly $k$ distinct cycles. If $k=2\text{ or }3$ we call it \textit{bicyclic} or \textit{tricyclic}, respectively. In a similar vein, we call a graph \textit{$k$-partite} if we can partition it's vertices into $k$ disjoint sets such that no two vertices in the same partite set share an edge. If $k=2\text{ or }3$, we call it \textit{bipartite} or \textit{tripartite}, respectively. These are broad families of graphs often used to characterize subsets of graphs within another family. The following are some more important families of graphs.

\begin{definition}[Complete Graph]
    The \textit{complete graph} on $n$ vertices, denoted $K_n$, is the
    graph on $n$ vertices such that every pair of distinct vertices shares an edge.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Complete Bipartite Graph]
    Let $m,n\in \NN$. The \textit{complete bipartite graph} $K_{m,n}$ is the bipartite graph whose vertices can be partitioned into two disjoint sets of sizes $m$ and $n$, respectively, such that every vertex in the one partite set is adjacent to \textbf{every} vertex in the other partite set and no two vertices in the same partite set are adjacent.

If all partite sets are the same size $n$ we call this graph the \textit{complete equipartite graph} and denote it via $K_{n:k}$ or $K_{n\times m}$.

We have now defined a few important families of graphs which we will refer to throughout the rest of this paper. Again, we generally don't explicitly define every graph by its vertex and edge sets and simply refer to it as some member of a family or say that it is isomorphic to a member of a family. This is much more efficient and concise than listing out all vertices and edges as we did in the beginning of this chapter.

We are now ready to move on and introduce graph decompositions, the objects which are the subject of this project.
