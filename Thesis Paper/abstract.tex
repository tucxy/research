Let $G$ be a subgraph of $K_n$ where $n \in \mathbb{N}$. A $G$-decomposition of $K_n$, or $G$-design of order $n$, is a finite collection $\mathcal{G} = \{G_1, \ldots, G_k\}$ of pairwise edge-disjoint subgraphs of $K_n$ that are all isomorphic to some graph $G$. We prove that an $F$-decomposition of $K_n$ exists for every seven-edge forest $F$ if and only if $n \equiv 0,1,7, \text{ or } 8 \pmod{14}$.

Along the way, we introduce new methods, constraint programming algorithms in Python, and some bonus results for Galaxy graph decompositions of complete bipartite, and eventually multipartite graphs.
