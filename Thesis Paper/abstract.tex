Let $G$ be a subgraph of $K_n$ where $n \in \mathbb{N}$. A $G$-decomposition of $K_n$, or $G$-design of order $n$, is a finite collection $\{G_{1}, \hdots, G_{k}\}$ of pairwise edge-disjoint subgraphs of $K_n$ that are all isomorphic to some graph $G$ and whose union is $K_{n}$. We prove that an $F$-decomposition of $K_n$ exists for every seven edge forest $F$ if and only if $n \equiv 0,1,7, \text{ or } 8 \pmod{14}$ and $n\geq 14$. We also share some additional results on edge mappings and galaxy decompositons of complete bipartite graphs along with some \verb|python| programs related to graphs and decompositions.
