\chapter{Additional Results}
In this chapter we present some generalizations of methods and theorems used previously to prove the main focus of this project.

Recall the technique we used to decompose $K_{n}$ where $n\equiv 7,8 \pmod{14}$ into all seven edge forests except the matching on seven edges and $\mathbf{T_{7}^{11}\sqcup T_{2}^{1}}$; The (1-2-3)-labelings of $3G$ and 1-rotational (1-2-3)-labelings $3G$ where $G$ is a seven edge forest. We generalize this to any $m$ edge graph $G$ and $G$-decomposition of $K_{n}$ where $n\equiv r\pmod{2m}$ and $r$ is an idempotent in the ring $\ZZ_{2m}$.
