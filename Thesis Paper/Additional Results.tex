Recall the definition of a (1-2-3)-labeling of $3G$ and a 1-rotational (1-2-3)-labeling of $4G$. When first solving the $7,8\pmod{14}$ cases, we used (8-9-10)-labelings allowing for wraparound edges for all forests except $\mathbf{T_{7}^{11}\sqcup T_{2}^{1}}$. We did this so that we could simply use the $\sigma^{+-}$ labeling of each forest to complete the decompositions.
