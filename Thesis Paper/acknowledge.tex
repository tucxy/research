There are many people that I am grateful to for their contribution to my time in the graduate program at the University of Minnesota: Duluth. First and foremost, my family has supported me through thick and thin on the frankly insane rollercoaster of a journey that led to my academic success. A close second, to all of my friends and peers on West 7th, I couldn't have done it without your guidance and support. Finally, without lucking into Professor Freyberg's Discrete Math class, I would not have had the opportunity to become a math student and later a math graduate student. I don't think I could really express how grateful I truly am that you took me under your wing. During my time in the master's program Professor Gallian's and Professor Froncek's courses and guidance has been very influential to the way I organize myself mathematically today.
