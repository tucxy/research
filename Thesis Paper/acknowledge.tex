There are many people that I am grateful to for their contribution to my time in the graduate program at the University of Minnesota: Duluth. First and foremost, I am grateful to my family who has supported me extensively throughout the ups and downs of my academic journey. Next I would like to thank my friends on West 7th in Saint Paul, who guided me and taught me everything I need to know in order to succeed in life. Also, I would like to thank Professor Gallian and Professor Froncek who have really influenced how I organize myself mathematically today. Lastly, I would like to thank my advisor Professor Freyberg who has supported and believed in me since I first attended his Discrete Math class in 2019. He has been the most influential presence in my development as a math student and as a mathematician, and I truly wouldn't be either of those if it weren't for him.
