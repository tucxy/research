I dedicate this Thesis to my advisor Professor Bryan Freyberg, to my family who has supported me throughout this process, and to Jeremy, Aaron, Mike B, Joe, Jordi, Ian, TK, and Torta from Tuscarora and West 7th. Thank you for believing in me when I couldn't and helping me realize what is possible when I apply myself. Especially to the Tusca boyz, we all made it somehow. Who would have thought.
